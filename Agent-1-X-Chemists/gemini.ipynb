      "\n",
      "Here's what I've gathered:\n",

      "*   **Chinese Name Confirmation:** Result clearly shows \"陶家友\" (Táo Jiāyǒu) as the Chinese name, alongside \"TAO Jiayou\" in English, as an author from \"湖南理工学院物理与电子学院\" (Hunan Institute of Science and Technology, School of Physics and Electronic Science). Result and also confirm \"陶家友\" at Hunan Institute of Science and Technology. Result further lists publications with \"Jiayou Tao\" and \"Li Chang\" from \"湖南理工学院 物理与电子科学学院\" (Hunan Institute of Science and Technology, School of Physics and Electronic Science), where Li Chang is an Associate Professor.\n",
      "*   **Affiliations:**\n",
      "    *   **Hunan Institute of Science and Technology (湖南理工学院):** This appears consistently across multiple relevant results. Specifically, \"物理与电子科学学院\" (School of Physics and Electronic Science) is mentioned. Result also shows Hunan Institute of Science and Technology as an applicant for a patent with \"Tao Jiayou\" listed.\n",
      "    *   **Xiangtan University (湘潭大学):** Result from the previous search explicitly listed \"School of Physics and Optoelectronics, Xiangtan University\" for \"Tao Jiayou\". While this particular search didn't directly confirm the Chinese name at Xiangtan University, the consistency of the English name and research area makes it highly probable this is the same person.\n",
      "    *   **Wuhan Institute of Technology (武汉工程大学):** Result from the previous search listed \"School of Mathematics and Physics, Wuhan Institute of Technology\". Similar to Xiangtan University, this current search didn't directly link the Chinese name. However, given the other strong hits, it's possible this is a past or concurrent affiliation.\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Title:** Result shows Li Chang, a co-author of \"Jiayou Tao\", has the title \"副教授\" (Associate Professor) at Hunan Institute of Science and Technology. While this doesn't directly state Tao Jiayou's title, it suggests the academic level within the same department. To be confident about Tao Jiayou's specific title, I would ideally find a faculty profile page.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let's try one more targeted search to find \"陶家友\" on the official website of Hunan Institute of Science and Technology's School of Physics and Electronic Science, or generally in Chinese academic profiles, to confirm the title.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Refined strategy:**\n",
      "1.  Search directly for \"陶家友\" on the official website of Hunan Institute of Science and Technology. I will look for faculty directories or personal pages.\n",
      "2.  Search for \"陶家友 教授\" or \"陶家友 副教授\" in combination with \"湖南理工学院\" to see if a specific title appears in search snippets or academic profiles (e.g., Baidu Scholar, ResearchGate Chinese profiles).\n",
