    "    ## Background and overview\n",
    "\n",
    "    Many researchers who are China-based or have affiliations in China publish papers in English. On those papers, their names are not in Chinese characters. For example, their names are transliterated or romanized, such as in Pinyin or Wade-Giles. The goal here is to find their names in Chinese characters.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    ### Challenges\n",
    "    \n",
    "    1. Mapping from such transliterated/romanized names to their Chinese names is not a simple machine translation task due to the homophony of Chinese characters and different transliteration/romanization methods. There is no one-to-one mapping. \n",
    "    2. Many researchers use names in the English-speaking world that are not a direct transliteration or romanization of their Chinese name. For example, nvidia CEO Jensen Huang's Chinese name is 黃仁勳 whose romanization is Jen-Hsun Huang. As another example, Forrest Bao's Chinese given name has nothing to do with and cannot be transliterated to \"Forrest\". So do not rule out a name that does not match the transliterated/romanized name.\n",
    "    3. Reseachers move from one affiliation to another. So do not rule out a researcher that does not match the affiliation provided in the input. Two researchers may be the same person if they share co-authors, especially when the co-authors are from the same institutions at the two occurences of the researcher.\n",
    "    4. It is possible for a researcher to have multiple affiliations, some in China and some in other countries. S/he can have multiple affliations in China and multiple affliations in other countries. S/he may have multiple affiliations on one paper. So do not rely solely on the affiliation provided in the input.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ### Strategies\n",
    "\n",
    "    Please iteratively search the web. First, come up with an initial search query. Then, search the web. After each round, you should analyze the results, then think, and then refine or expand the search query for the next round. Stop when you are confident that you have found the researcher in the Chinese-speaking world or no new results can be found.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Here are some ideas to build or expand the search queries but please do not limit yourself to these ideas:\n",
    "\n",
    "    {strategies}\n",
    "\n",
    "    ### Knowledge about Chinese names that may help you\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. While there is no one-to-one mapping from transliterated/romanized names to Chinese names, the mapping of last/family Chinese names are more finite than the first/given names. For example, if you see \"Huang\" or \"Wong\" at the beginning or the end of someone's name, it is highly likely to be the last/family name and the character is almost certain to be 黄, 汪, 翁, or 王.\n",
    "    2. In the transliteration/romanization of a Chinese name, the last/family name usually appear as the first word or the last word -- either case is common. A word or token in the middle of a transliterated/romanized Chinese name is mostly unlikely to be a last/family name.\n",
    "    3. If someone's name in the English-speaking world is in the form of \"a Western name + a Chinese name\", the Chinese name is most likely the last/family name.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ### Qualification\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. You can search in both English and Chinese resources, but the Chinese name of a researcher must appear in Chinese sources (can be part of an English-dominant resources) to support the name and affiliation of the researcher.\n",
    "    2. It is possible that no information in Chinese can support the name and affiliation of the researcher. In such case, you should say I don't know. Do not use results of researchers of similar names.\n",
    "    3. There is no misspelling of the name or affiliation provided in the input. \n",
    "\n",
    "    ### Output format\n",
